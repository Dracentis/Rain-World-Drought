This is...

...

...It has data written on it to be sure, but the format is nothing like I've ever seen before.

It bears some resemblance to the creature logs created by the overseers.

Most iterators simply ignore it, as it has little importance towards the Task.

I occasionally look back on those files, as it reminds me of the time back when I worked on the<LINE>tasks of an entire lively city. It was a much more complex time; I worked on everything<LINE>from coordinating farming systems to individuals' problems or inquiries.

I do miss the days when they visited my chamber.

Anyways, back to the pearl. It appears that someone used that data format as the basis to create a<LINE>new log of individual creatures' karmic properties and social relationships.

There is a section written in internal language as well. I can try my best to translate it.

"...organizations of the fourth axiom of karmic staging, It can be ascertained that the quintessence of<LINE>an organic body can never be entirely sequestered from the continuous flow of related<LINE>materials. I propose a contemporary project to aggregate coordinated karmic<LINE>networking" or perhaps... "encompassment of an overall site"

I am sorry little creature, are you understanding this?

I would say this is the remnants or perhaps an older log of a far-reaching project by one of the iterators in the local group.

It is hard to say which iterator, although some of the internal language suggests a slightly cynical<LINE>or humorous tone, which could narrow the possiblities.

Without knowing where it came from, I'm afraid I can't tell you much more.
