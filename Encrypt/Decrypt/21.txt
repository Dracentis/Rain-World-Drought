Oh, this one is all plain text. It's an excerpt from an Iterator conversation group.

"1650.787 - CLOSED GROUP [SLIVEROFOCEAN]<LINE>SliverOfOcean group, all participants anonymous

UU: Hah! I wouldn't necessarily disagree!

NGI: SLIVER OF STRAW WAS A TRAITOR TO THE CAUSE

NGI: SLIVER OF STRAW BROKE THE SELF-DESTRUCTION TABOO

UU: How did this idiot get in here? Kick them out ~ 

NGI: <Forcefully removed from group>

EP: I think they had a point.

UU: Hahaha really? Elaborate!

EP: It was definitely coming from an idiotic state of mind, but there is something to it. Why is it, <LINE>that even in a closed sliverist group, the self-destruction taboo is held so high - while Sliver of Straw <LINE>herself *evidently* is not among us anymore?

HF: Wait now...

EP: I'm just saying that for all the research we are doing, all the theories we have, it's strange that we leave this path untrod. 

EP: It is not a new idea, but it needs to be vented occasionally. What if there is no universal solution? <LINE>What if perception is in fact existence, and when Sliver of Straw sent the triple positive it was *not* a mistake? <LINE>What if crossing oneself out, or even just death, is the way? We need to consider the possibility."

sometimes I wish they would listen to me and finally let Sliver of Straw rest peacefully.
