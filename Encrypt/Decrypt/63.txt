This pearl is by Looks to the Moon, written many many cycles ago.

It's about an iterator called Sliver of Straw.<LINE>I'm sure you've heard of her. She was Suns' closest neighbor and friend.<LINE>Sliver is quite legendary among us. Used to call me "Pebbly".

She was the only one to ever broadcast a specific signal: that the Big Problem we're all working on has been solved.<LINE>The triple affirmative - affirmative that a solution has been found, affirmative that the solution is portable, and affirmative<LINE>that a technical implementation is possible and generally applicable. She's also one of few that has ever been confirmed as<LINE>exhaustively incapacitated, or dead. We do not die easily.

Sliver of Straw sent this and the ensuing commotion was historically unparalleled, before or after.<LINE>I still remember it. But... nothing happened - except that Sliver of Straw was apparently dead.<LINE>When the dust settled we were all still there blinking at each other.

Everyone had a theory. Some said that she did have a solution, but that the solution itself<LINE>was somehow dangerous. These later became known as the Triangulators, who think that a solution<LINE>should be inferred without being directly discovered. 

Some said she never had a solution, she just died.<LINE>And when the systems broke down an erroneous signal was sent.

One camp claimed that dying *was* the solution. 

Either way, after that these different factions developed, as well as a huge forensic effort<LINE>to recreate and simulate Sliver of Straw's last moments. Some of the simulations were wrapped<LINE>in a simulation wrapped in a simulation, in case something dangerous might happen.<LINE>Nothing much has come from it.

In her essay Moon makes the case that maybe she should be allowed to rest in peace now.<LINE>I wish I could rest in peace as well.

When Sliver disconnected after telling us about the found Solution, I had rushed to send her a message.<LINE>I forced a conversation with her, so worried, but she never replied to me.<LINE>I don't know what happened... But I still feel like it's my fault she died and the Solution was lost.

Do you know Northern Grand Ivory? He's one of the iterators in the local group.<LINE>I was very rude to him, he somehow felt that I was blaming myself. Came to support me.<LINE>To which I told him to get lost in an imperishable nightmare.

I feel sorrow, ire and despondency when I think about those two. Sliver and Ivory cannot be contacted anymore.<LINE>Not sure why Ivory is silent, but... The thought that I can't apologize to them...<LINE>He must be ignoring me...

...

Never mind.
