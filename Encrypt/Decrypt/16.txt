This one... is authored by Five Pebbles, when he was young. There has been an attempt to<LINE>scramble the data, but it's sloppily done, and most is still somewhat legible.<LINE>He matured since then, but I haven't seen any written attempts from him ever since.

It's written in internal language, or thoughts, so it is hard for me to translate so you would understand. It's a methodology for<LINE>global ascension of course - quite good, although the Peripherists or the Slab Mongers certainly wouldn't agree!

"...considering the eight and the twenty sixth amendments to the Capricious Dogma, we are apparently supposed to take<LINE>for granted that a meaning collector point inversion is the only way to approach what has later become referred to<LINE>as 'noise milking' (or occasionally 'rock swatting'). I will argue my disagreement with this, not in regards to kind<LINE>but in regards to..." Could it say... "volume"? Actually, are you getting anything out of this?

I must be exhausting you with my blabber. I can get carried away at times with the texts. I remember most of them, but sometimes<LINE>small particles of this vital information escape me. I'm glad it's safe in this pearl though! We will have a lot<LINE>to save up for the future inhabitants.

By any chance... Did you find this in his waste department?<LINE>I mean Five Pebbles', of course.

I don't think there's any reason for him to keep that, I'm convinvced he threw it away long, long ago.<LINE>It's kind of sad, really. He started off really pious and hard working, eager to solve The Task and<LINE>share the knowledge, but he's been very, very quiet. Perhaps his solutions are failing over and over...

I'll cheer him up - and you take the pearl. I have no need in it now, and no one but us, iterators, can cleanse it of<LINE>stored information. The waste department isn't that spacious, so maybe there are other pearls for you to find there.

Oh, but be careful! The pearls in the waste masses inevitably attract scavengers, which can be very dangerous when provoked. 

But, you seem to have made it out of there. I'm proud of you, <PlayerName>.
