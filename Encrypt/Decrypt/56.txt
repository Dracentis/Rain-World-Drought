Ah, that. Moon scanned it long time ago, ages after ages well into the past.<LINE>It's interesting, to say the least. Let me enlighten you.

It's a little text of spiritual guidance. Those were abound, and everyone zealously read them.<LINE>This one is written by a monk called Four Cabinets, Eleven Hatchets.<LINE>I have no information on him, you will have to ask Suns.<LINE>The text itself is old, several ages before the Void Fluid revolution. 

This text, like most writing from this time, is quite shrouded in analogies, but the subject is how to shed<LINE>one of the five natural urges which tie a creature to life.

It's a long poem on how you, the one who wants to ascend, should remain occluded for the remainder of your life.<LINE>Well, it's not really a poem... More of an instruction on how to starve yourself.<LINE>And how to be fine with that, grateful even.

Now of course when Void Fluid was discovered these methods proved obsolete, as it was<LINE>more easy just jumping in a vat of it to effortlessly leave this world behind. 

There were some horror stories though... That if your ego was big enough, not even the Void Fluid could<LINE>entirely cross you out, and a faint echo of your pompousness would grandiosely haunt the premises forever.

So even when the Void Fluid baths became cheaper,<LINE>some would still lock themselves away from the world.
