[DESCRIPTION]
Rain World Drought is a mod for Rain World that adds a new slugcat (The Wanderer), 
4 new regions, new creatures, and additional lore to the game. This mod was created as an 
expansion for Rain World. No major base game improvement were made, but a lot of code changes
make this mod likely incompatible with other mods.

[Features]
 * Over 350 new screens to explore across 4 new regions.
 * New slugcat (The Wanderer) with their own unique storyline.
 * New creatures, arenas, and unlockables.
 * Many new environmental features and items.
