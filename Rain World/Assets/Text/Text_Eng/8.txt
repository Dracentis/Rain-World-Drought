Is this for me? Must be what Seven Red Suns wanted to deliver.<LINE>I have been awaiting this message.

...Oh, instructions! Finally, some sapid information on how to circumvent the taboo.

You know, <PlayerName>, the problem with breaking taboos is that the barriers are encoded<LINE>into every cell of our organic parts. And we can't rewrite it...

Not yet, at least.

Hmmm... Interesting... A small sample of living organic matter...<LINE>Re-write genome and... Oh, rewrite it this way, hm.

This does not rewrite everything from the looks of it.<LINE>A very specific taboo, nothing more...<LINE>I assume this is based on Sliver's past rewrites, although for some microbes, not large creatures.

...This will be very difficult, but I think I can give it a shot.<LINE>If Suns' multilayered triangulations showed fruitful results - then my tests...

. . .

<PlayerName>, I forgot you were standing here. I got<LINE>so enthralled... I apologize.

This is extremely promising, and it will require a lot of focus and work from me.<LINE>Our small group would not get this far without your help.<LINE>The least I could reward you with is what everyone wants.

Your purpose ends here, <PlayerName>. You have worked very hard, and I think you<LINE>deserve some rest, at last. The pearl will remain here, with me.

From your memories you might unearth that one time I mentioned<LINE>Void Sea to you. This is your salvation.

Sliver would be very proud of you, little slugcat.<LINE>If I remember correctly... This is the name she gave to your species?<LINE>If she could, I'm sure she'd thank you as well.

From now on your job as an envoy is over. I will inform Suns that you succeeded.<LINE>I'll be very busy, so don't come back.

If you want - say hello to Moon for me.
