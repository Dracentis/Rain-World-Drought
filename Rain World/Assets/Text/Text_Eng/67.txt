It's an old conversation between me and Looks to the Moon. Back when we were closer and I wasn't<LINE>so busy.

"1598.710 - PRIVATE<LINE>Big Sis Moon, Five Pebbles

BSM: I'm starting a parallel process to handle a new iteration. I'm trying a new method, but only once. It doesn't seem very productive. 

BSM: Please, refrain from using groundwater and redirect your resources to desalination filter. This won't last long, a cycle at max, and I apologize for inconvenience. 

FP: Stop. You're always apologizing for something so silly that it really boggles my mind. I can take it, don't worry. 

BSM: Alright. If it's somehow successful, even though the estimated chance of it working is less than 0.0037%,<LINE>I'll pass you the heap data so you can use the method for yourself and speed up our work.

FP: I do not want to hurt you. But thank you. Right now I'm iterating through the methods described in Fourteen Towers' records.<LINE>It goes against twenty sixth amendment of Capricious Dogma, but I don't think it's of any concern to us.

BSM: Understood. Thank you for your hard work!

FP: It's nothing, Moon! Now, I should return to work. I really hope your method does end up being fruitful."

And now look at us. We rarely communicate anymore.<LINE>Both of us have grown weary with The Task.
