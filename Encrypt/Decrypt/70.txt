This one has plain text about me. Let me cut the lengthy introductions...

"...we will not consider the Current Situation acceptable. Although our community is Blessed with an ever<LINE>shrinking Population, and we can Almost Glimpse that Glorious moment when the last of us has joined our<LINE>most Admired peers, we must still (at All Times!) maintain Good Relations with our Iterator. 

The Moral Argument: Five Pebbles is our Creation, and we have Parental Obligations towards him. As an Iterator,<LINE>he is also a Gift of Charity from Us to The World (unable to reach Enlightenment by itself - being composed mostly<LINE>of Rock, Gas, dull witted Bugs and Microbes - and towards which We thus have Obligations).

The Practical Argument: Despite You being family, I must Beg Forgiveness for the<LINE>Blunt Vulgarity - but We are (for as long as we Remain) Dependent on Five Pebbles <LINE>for Water, Nectar, Energy, Void Fluid and All other Vital Resources. <LINE>By Now, living on the surface is Laughable. <LINE>We are Across the River and have Kicked out the Boat.

I therefor ask you to Do Anything in your Might to stop the House(We both know which House)<LINE>from Further Obstruction! They have less than forty members on the Council, but still Tilt<LINE>the spiritual Discourse with Our Iterator in a direction that most obviously Displeases him,<LINE>and is hardly High Held by anyone in the Community either! We can not Risk this!"

And then there are polite farewells. I'm grateful for their worries, but let us be clear.<LINE>To them - I am everything. To me - they are nothing. It's laughable to think that I'd think of them as anything else but parasites.<LINE>Throw that pearl away somewhere. I have no need to know anything about what they used to think.
