It's me writing to Five Pebbles. A really old conversation...

"1598.710 - PRIVATE<LINE>Big Sis Moon, Five Pebbles

BSM: I'm starting a parallel process to handle a new iteration. I'm trying a new method, but only once. It doesn't seem very productive. 

BSM: Please, refrain from using groundwater and redirect your resources to desalination filter. This won't last long, a cycle at max, and I apologize for inconvenience. 

FP: Stop. You're always apologizing for something so silly that it really boggles my mind. I can take it, don't worry. 

BSM: Alright. If it's somehow successful, even though the estimated chance of it working is less than 0.0037%,<LINE>I'll pass you the heap data so you can use the method for yourself and speed up our work.

FP: I do not want to hurt you. But thank you. Right now I'm iterating through the methods described in Fourteen Towers' records.<LINE>It goes against twenty sixth amendment of Capricious Dogma, but I don't think it's of any concern to us.

BSM: Understood. Thank you for your hard work!

FP: Return to work or I won't accept your method if it works. I really hope it does."

And now look at us. So many thousands of cycles passed. He changed so much, so weary now. 

He's doing his best to this day though! I'm very proud of him.
