This is a slime mold plasmodium. My records say, that they can grow significantly bigger on very, very rare occasions.<LINE>The glow from the bigger ones must be quite a sight.

Besides that - can you take it away? I know it looks beautiful, and is probably very tasty for you, but<LINE>I can't imagine from what damp place you brought it to me.

Oh, I know! Show it to Moon. She's a bit squeamish so maybe you'll scare her with that, haha.<LINE>Though then she would probably give you a lecture on spirituality or something.

I never really believed what monks taught me - not as much as Moon did.<LINE>She'd tell you something about this unicellular mold, something dreary or sublime for sure.

But what I see in this world doesn't always coincide with what our ancestors told us.
