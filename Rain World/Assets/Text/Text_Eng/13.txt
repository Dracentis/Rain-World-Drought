Seventeen Axes, Fifteen Spoked Wheel nobly decided to ascend in the beginning of  1514.008, after graciously donating all (ALL!) earthly<LINE>possessions to the local Iterator project (Unparalleled Innocence), and left these memories to be cherished by the carnal plane. 

The assorted memories and qualia include:
