Oh...

Hello, <PlayerName>.

You must be Seven Red Suns' little messenger.

I have heard a lot about you. How is Seven Red Suns?

I am glad to see you safe and sound, it's clear that your tail is working as intended.

I have considered tinkering with creatures too. More messengers could be useful.

Communications have always been spotty, even back when our cities were still populated.

Soon enough, messengers like you might be our only way of communicating.

I... I've been holding you here for a while, little creature. I'm sorry! I'm aware that you have to go.

Thank you for visiting me! Good luck on your way to Five Pebbles!
