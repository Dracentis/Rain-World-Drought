While you've been on your way to me, I've picked up traces of an unpleasant, musty<LINE>smell coming from you. This must be the reason, correct?<LINE>I suppose I could read this to you, but I still wonder how you've got it.

It's... an old pearl related to our local intake system. By our I mean mine and Pebbles'.

Specifically, it has details on microorganisms used in the main reservoir.

The complete report is thousands of entries long, discussing everything from the<LINE>central gravity-amplifier-style intake solution to the interactions with the developed fauna.<LINE>I'll give you the gist of it.

Back when cities were closer to the surface, filtered water reservoirs<LINE>were created as bioreactors to purify water and remove contaminants.

The organisms inside those reservoirs weren't kept under constant control,<LINE>and thus many different, quite undesirable strains of them infected the water and<LINE>filter tissue, corrupting early reservoirs.

Some strains were even observed blending with the natural fauna, creating extremely<LINE>resilient organisms of a very large scale. On some occasions they would grow a colony<LINE>near the filters, feeding onto incoming particles and growing like mold.

Eventually a strain of bacteria was made to keep the waters clean. The deed was not well<LINE>received by the monks, especially during the supremacy of Pisceous Dogma,<LINE>but it was required for me and other similar iterators to work properly.

It took a lot of time, but the bacteria seemed to bear fruits, working as intended.<LINE>From what this report has, it seems the bacteria absorbs any undesirable 'taint' and<LINE>converts it into air? I assume it has to be breathable, but the formulae are so long...

<PlayerName>, I take it you dove into... Oh, you don't have to answer, it's obvious<LINE>where you got this. Iâ€™m not sure how the tank would react to you.

To be honest, I'm not even sure if the bacteria are safe, now that I've read the report!<LINE>But I suppose the mark Suns gave you would help, in a way.
