It's an active working memory - raw data has been dropped here in order to later be<LINE>pasted to a currently occupied memory conflux. Without context it's just a jumble.
A common prayer mantra repeated 7110 times. Each repetition has some slight random variations, which seem to have been written later.
It's an image of a single grey cloud, hovering above a surface of white clouds under a deep blue sky. 
Two... intertwined number series? I don't quite understand the utility of this. <LINE>Might a key for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.
It's qualia, or a moment - a very short one. Someone is holding a black stone, <LINE>and twisting it slightly as they drag their finger across the rough surface. <LINE>The entire sequence is shorter than a heartbeat, but the resolution is extraordinary. 
An active working memory. Without knowing where this was cut from or where it's to be pasted to, <LINE>it is not really possible to decipher it. If I had to guess, I would say it has something to <LINE>do with trance inducing number series. 
It's just an active working memory, I can't really tell you anything without the context.
Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you. It might have something to do with Void Fluid simulation...
This one is completely blank. Actually, blanker than blank, it must have been deliberately <LINE>overwritten with repeating negative versions of itself for thousands of iterations. 
A memory... but not really visual, or even concrete, in its character. It reminds of<LINE>the feeling of a warm wind, but not the physical feeling but the... inner feeling. <LINE>I don't think it has much utility unless you are doing some very fringe Regeneraist research.
This is just the word "where" repeated 85310 times. Possibly an error of sorts, one of the processes got stuck in a loop.
This is some sort of a very long cipher. Four sets of numbers, intertwined together and passing through<LINE>medium-resolution qualiae, adjusting the sequence in the process to fit specific needs of the iterator.<LINE>Think of it as a key to the drawer with your recent notes. Though, I'm not sure you know what a drawer is...
How peculiar. This is a high resolution image of you, <PlayerName>! This must be one of many very early concepts<LINE>of a purposed creature for deliveries. Not everything can be sent over text, you know.
This is a saved state of a process unfinished. Actually, there is more than one on this pearl. And despite<LINE>the cycles between the versions - there is absolutely no difference between them.
A perfectly encoded qualia! This one is completely dark though, there is nothing to see, except a<LINE>certain... How do I put it... Inner feeling? Of heaviness. A feeling of a immensely integral burden.<LINE>I cannot fathom whose qualia it is.
This pearl is filled to the brim with jumbled mess. I could try to run some analyses on it, but I'm sure<LINE>without the process itself around it - I won't be able to make out anything sensible.
A recent scan of a memory conflux. Nothing out of the ordinary.
It's a set of images, containing Five Pebbles' inner layout, a picture of the monks that built him,<LINE>a cloudless blue sky at that day. It has happened ages ago, It is very sweet of him to keep the<LINE>memory. Of course, it's all encrypted over and over, but during his earlier days he wasn't skilled at encrypting.
An array of various qualia, all of them are... Hmm, not sure if I should tell you. They're momentary<LINE>images of dissecting a creature for genome extraction. Some of the iterators, not just<LINE>in our local group, used to do that to try some solutions for The Task. This was deemed unsafe later.
This is a working memory, an active one of course. Without the context - I can't say anything about what<LINE>it actually is. Though, the data seems to be divided into two parts - and the second part is<LINE>some kind of sound? It's a rhythmic buzzing of bugs, mixed with clanking metal.
These are multiple forensic reports on the mutilated corpses of creatures outside the can.<LINE>I assume these attempts were to see if any of them died not from the downpour, in hopes at least one<LINE>creature was strong enough to endure it. An attempt to breed a new generation, capable to withstand the rain?
