Oh my, careful! My analysis reports are detecting flammable powder inside!

I wonder where did you get it? There is a lot of it, stuffed into some kind of shell.<LINE>I would be very careful around this!

Did scavengers make this? Where did they get that powder?<LINE>This is simply fantastic...

I would lie if I said I'm not speechless. In my records, this flammable powder dates back to ages, no, eons back in our time!<LINE>Long, long ago before we were even built. No one spoke about it ever, however one of our ancestors, from another<LINE>land mentioned it to other monks.

From them I learned that it was destroyed long ago, to stop something from happening ever again. I think... it was<LINE>called "war"? It was so long ago, and there is so little information on it, that my memory is a bit hazy.

To think the scavengers are smart enough to make their own flammable powder... And it's not like there is a stash<LINE>of it anywhere near our citadel grounds! Simply fantastic.
