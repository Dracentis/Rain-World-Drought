It is the genome for a purposed organism.<LINE>A small slug to clean the insides of pipes.

Do you know what a purposed organism is? Actually you are talking to one right now!

Most purposed organisms were considerably smaller than me, and most barely looked like organisms at all.<LINE>More like tubes in metal boxes, where something went in one end and something else came out the other.

There were of course those that were purposed for spectacle rather than industry - they enjoyed the privilege of glass boxes. 

When I came into this world there was very little primal fauna left.<LINE>So it's highly likely that you are the descendant of a purposed organism yourself!
