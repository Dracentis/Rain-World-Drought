This is a mask of a predatory vulture. Made of incredibly light, yet strong material - it is crucial to them, for<LINE>that is how vultures recognize each other. Suns told me so once. I suppose the creature you took it<LINE>off of is now being bullied by its own kin.

In a way - this reminds me of our ancestors. They too wore masks to abate purge their selves.<LINE>Can't say vultures do that to cleanse themselves like that... But the semblance is obvious.

And even though their masks are so uniform - they still recognize each other somehow.<LINE>This is something my creators couldn't achieve.

Naughty, but I should give credit to you, to take it off and survive is quite... Cool.
