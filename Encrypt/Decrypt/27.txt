It's a part of some kind of plant. The glowing is strange...<LINE>I wouldn't look directly into it, but... Let me look at it closer.

...

Hmm, interesting! My disquisitional analysis says that this plant can produce a violent bright flash when thrown.<LINE>The outer layer heats up a little, damaging the membrane, and then when thrown - even a small<LINE>temperature reduction is enough to make it burst!

Then the chemicals quickly oxidize, starting a violent reaction...<LINE>Wait a second, little creature. Are you... actually getting anything out of this?

Perhaps I let myself get carried away too much. I apologize, but this is truly fascinating!<LINE>The monks barely taught me anything about flora and fauna of our world.<LINE>My world is built around their mantras, I am molded by them.

I truly pity other iterators, who might not have had been taught the truths of our world.<LINE>We're all too busy to share what we know though.

Anyway, I've been keeping you here for too long. Just throw this plant to make an obscenely bright flash.<LINE>Close your eyes before it goes off!
