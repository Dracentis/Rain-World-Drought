Can you see us, little creature? Wondrous.

Your attunement feels... much closer to ours. What an unimaginable gift you have...

Do you suffer? Or do you exist with a different purpose?<LINE>How come you are still here?

Are your struggles true? Or do you accept them?<LINE>What keeps you clinging to cycles?

Such a peculiar little creature. Do not worry. You shall continue.

But when the time comes - you shall disappear with the morning dew.
