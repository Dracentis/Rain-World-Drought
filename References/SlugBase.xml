            The character to copy creatures and world state from.
            The value should be 0 (survivor), 1 (monk) or 2 (hunter).

            The name of this character must be unique; other mods that add a character of this same name will throw an exception
            when registering their character. If your name is likely to cause conflicts (such as any of the vanilla achievement
            names), then consider prefixing your player's name with some other text, like the author's name.
