It's a confirmation to an automated farming plot that a shipment of beverages has arrived.<LINE>Happened thousands of cycles ago, the scans of the confirmation are still in my memory.

Would you like me to read it out loud to you? Not that you'd bother reading into the nuances<LINE>of the phraseology, but my time with you is a nice outlet for my languor.

"On regards of the (by spiritual splendor eternally graced) people of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness,<LINE>we Wish to congratulate (o so thankfully) this Facility on its Loyal and Relished services, and to Offer our Hopes and<LINE>Aspirations that the Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation may continue, for as long as the Stars stay fixed on their<LINE>Celestial Spheres and/or the Cooperation continues to be Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory."

"Leaning on the Solid Foundation of our Long Running Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation, we will take the liberty of stating<LINE>The Reason for this Message ~ we write to Warmly thank You for yet Another Timely and Appreciated delivery of your Product (Nectar) to our<LINE>Community (Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness). Our humble Words can never Aspire to Describe our gratitude."

"Sincerely, your Appreciative and Satisfied Acquirers: Nine Snails, Unhurried Turtle; Zero Flaws Many Concerns;<LINE>Four Safes Eleven Fliers; Round Apple Abreast Bread;..."  The titles are many.

I never understood the reason of such correctness. Little ants worried about their little things.<LINE>And only slowing themselves down by talking, writing nonsense all day long.
