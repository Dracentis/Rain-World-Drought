This is a hallucinogenic mushroom. It is not edible, but a few shouldn't hurt you.<LINE>Just, don't eat too many.

One of my... One of iterators, Northern Grand Ivory, tried to use these mushrooms to create a purposed organism.<LINE>You know, one that would be in a constant hallucinogenic state, with heightened senses and reflexes.

I'm not sure it went well. Imagine trying to escape the cycles, but everything is slowed down around you.<LINE>The maddening slowdown that makes you suffer for twice as long.

Maybe that creature tried to die, only to be reborn over and over and over and over and over again.<LINE>We're all suffering, of course, but who knows how much that one suffered already.

I think I spoke too much. Sorry, little creature, I tend to get distracted by these thoughts. Here, take it back - and go.
