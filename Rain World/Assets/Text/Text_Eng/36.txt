It's the pupa of a small flying creature.<LINE>Inside are nutritions necessary for their healthy growth. Their genomes at some point were used for<LINE>creation of iterator's neurons. However - it didn't work out, so our ancestors worked with a different bug instead.

Those bugs can live for up to 10 cycles. Perhaps you saw them flying around near my can?<LINE>Perhaps you even grabbed them to traverse bigger distances? At least I think this is the right bug.<LINE>Blue coloration is common in pupae, besides I'm not SRS - I am no master of the fauna.

Few of them survive, but they are born anew a couple of cycles later. Revived, resurrected, reincarnated.<LINE>Trapped in an infinite cycle of life and death.

They have no brains to truly understand the tragedy of their situation they're in.<LINE>You can eat it, I don't mind. I have no need for it anyway. If anything - I'd like it out of my can.
