Oh, I remember this. I can't say I don't regret some of my actions.<LINE>I'll read it to you.

"1627.104 - PUBLIC [FORCED]<LINE>Sliver Of Straw to Local Group + {NGI}

SOS: Everyone! I have a pleasant announcement~ 

FP: Ugh! What is it?

GW: Sliver, hello. You might have accidentally started a forced communication line with the entirety of our Local Group.

HF: Wind, she doesn't have the privileges, she can't force a group chat unless the solution is true and tried.

FP: Terrible feeling. I hope it's something serious.

NGI: Shut up for once and let her talk.

BSM: Please, speak up, what happened? For someone who started the whole conversation - you haven't written anything yet. I'm worried.

NSH: Haha, come on, she's shy, you know it. Come on girl, say it! We've got the stuff to help ya with if you need some!

SOS: Triple affirmative!

SRS: ...No way.

NGI: Oh? Did, by any chance, my instructions I had delivered to you all those cycles ago bear fruits?

FP: What? Have you found a solution? Please, don't tell me it's a joke.

SOS: Not a joke, Pebbly~ Triple affirmative! I found it!

NSH: That's some serious stuff you spoke just now, Sliver, careful.

SOS: [left the conversation]

FP: Sliver?

NGI: What just happened? Somebody contact her again this instant! This isn't something to joke about.

FP: [left the conversation]

BSM: Oh, come on...

NSH: I have to agree with Ivory, feels like a terrible joke. Heh, and I almost believed it!<LINE>To think that The Task could finally be solved. Ivory - I owe you.

NGI: Told you it isn't something to believe... If I wasn't successful yet - Sliver definitely<LINE>wouldn't find a solution by now.

HF: Yes, but... She forced a chat with an entire local group without privileges, this must mean that she has the solution.

NGI: There are around 7 more eligible events that would allow one to force such a communication<LINE>with others, Halcyon. We need to confirm the solution first before we jump to conclusions!<LINE>Where did Pebbles go?

BSM: I hope he isn't angry. He could leave the conversation to start another one with Sliver.

GW: She's probably cleaning up, saving... Maybe. I cannot fathom the process...

SRS: I can't wait to get the information! The relief I feel right now is indescribable!

NGI: If her words are true, of course. I don't believe them. She disconnected so suddenly.

SRS: I'm sure she's fine. And I trust her, I am her closest neighbor.

NSH: Your overseers can see what she's doing right now, right? Would be a funny joke, if that turned out a lie.<LINE>...Not so funny if she died from the solution itself."

We... couldn't contact her afterward. <LINE>Seven Red Suns confirmed later, that there was no rain from her can.

He didn't have to though. I have been personally monitoring her. I have sent my overseers out as far as possible. Any further and the connection would cut out.<LINE>I monitored her can for dozens of cycles non-stop, but it was as if she froze in time completely.<LINE>No rain, no signs of processing - nothing.

Back then, I left to start a communication with her.<LINE>I hoped to ask her why she left, but... No one knows what happened.

She was very important to me and Suns. The most creative and upbeat iterator, even more so than Suns.<LINE>But I feel like because of me something went wrong and thus I killed her.<LINE>We all miss her greatly, Suns the most, but with her gone I find myself stuck in desperation more often.
