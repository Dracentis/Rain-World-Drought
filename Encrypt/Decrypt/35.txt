This is a plant formally known as a 'Wheel Flower'. They were one of the symbols for enlightenment as they have some<LINE>interesting carnal properties. Long ago I tried to study them in hopes of unearthing some unseen meaning.

Turns out there's only so much complexity in a hallucinogenic plant.

Still, I wonder what sanctioned such desirability to certain contemplative persons.
