<PlayerName>, my connection with you grows weaker. I think it's time for a farewell.
You're reaching the end of your journey, aren't you?
Before you go - thank you. For helping me, and for helping us.

/// Moon Conversation ///
// Moon Second+ Conversation, when she doesn't dislike you
// I wonder what it is that you want? // The following line comes after this vanilla dialogue
I have very little to give you.
// When you give Moon her own Neuron
This is one of my processing neurons, I need them for continued operation.
Please don't eat too many of these.
// Moon Conversation after MoonMark
Head west. Towards No Significant Harassment.
Deep down, there's an old subway system. And below that, an ancient temple.
Search your way deeper. The mark I gave you will let you through.
Good luck, <PlayerName>.
// Before Giving Mark
Here.
// Grabbed MoonPearl

Let us try again - not that it has worked well before. I was saying...
As I tried to say to you... // 5th and so on
If you behave like this, why should I talk to you?
You come here, but you can't be respectful enough to listen to me.<LINE>Will you listen this time?
Now, if you let me, I will try to say this again.
// Before Giving Mark
Just a minute, little messenger.

It's a rock. I have no use for this. // Rock
This is one of my processing neurons, don't eat any. // Pebbles' Neuron
It's a piece of sharpened rebar... What is it you want to know?<LINE>I've seen you use them very effectively. // Spear
It's a weapon made with fire powder. Did the scavengers give this to you?<LINE>It could be very dangerous if used incorrectly! // Explosive Spear
It's an edible plant. You could use the energy! // Waternut
Is this one of Moon's neurons? // Moon's Neuron

// Dialogue after Pebbles gave you mark
Go to the west past the Farm Arrays, and then down into the<LINE>earth where the land fissures, as deep as you can reach, where the ancients<LINE>built their temples and danced their silly rituals. The mark I gave you will let you through.
Best of luck to you, <PlayerName>.
// Any Pearl Intro
Ah, a pearl. Not the message though. Would you like me to read it to you? // 1st
Another pearl! You want me to read this one too? Just a moment... // 2nd
And yet another one! I will read it to you. // 3rd
Another? Your thirst for knowledge is really something!<LINE>Or is it that my readings calm your spirits? // 4th
Let us see...<LINE>To be honest with you, <PlayerName>, I'm as curious to see what's in it as you are. // 4th, extra remark when 5p likes

And yet another one! I will read it to you in a moment.
So many of these lately! I see you've been wandering the world a lot.

It has been recently written to.
This pearl has been written to just now! // 3
Let's see... A pearl... // 4
And this one is sharp! It was not long ago this data was written to it!

/// SRS Conversation (that's less than two lines) /// 
// SRSDreamPearlLF
The absurd amount of properness they spoke with still amuses me.
// SRSDreamPearlDS
There was an eternal dilemma to them - they were burdened by great ambition,<LINE>yet deeply convinced that striving in itself was an unforgivable vice.
They tried very hard to be effortless. Perhaps that's what we were to them,<LINE>someone to delegate that unrestrained effort to.
// SRSDreamPearlSI
We are all aware of the futility of our Task.<LINE>Even the most dedicated iterators out there have felt frustration over our seemingly pointless efforts.
It's not like we have anything else we could do. It's either iterate or do nothing.
// SRSDreamPearlSI4
Looks to the Moon and Five Pebbles were once very talkative iterators.
They were a lot closer than many iterators believed.<LINE>By now they've grown distant, both feeling weary with The Task.
// SRSDreamPearlSU
Death isn't the end - birth and death are connected to each other like a ring,<LINE>or some say a spiral. Some say a spiral that in turn forms a ring. Some ramble in agonizing longevity.<LINE>But the basis is agreed upon: like sleep like death, you wake up again - whether you want to or not.
// SRSDreamPearlUW
The relations between iterators and their populations were strained in the cycles leading up to global ascension.
Many people were disrespectful and some of the iterators returned that disrespect.
// SRSDreamPearlIS
There are still many things that I have yet to learn about my creator's past.
// SRSDreamPearlMW
You should return this to Looks to the Moon.
