How bright and beautiful!

This is a pupa shell, smeared on the inside with a glowing substance consisting of, as my analyses say,<LINE>chemiluminescent bacteria, that are present in blood of some creatures. I'm not sure which one exactly, but there aren't many<LINE>species living nearby, so that narrows the options. Either way, that is a curious symbiosis!

Have you been to the citadel we are standing above? This shell will prove useful there!<LINE>Ever since the fall of Ancients, it's been in a disarray. The numerous candles that<LINE>adorned the halls are long gone, who knows what lives there now.

You should definitely visit the place! The wondrous architecture of the times - it must be still intact!<LINE>You will see so many things - the ritual hall, the cabinets, the ornaments on the windows!<LINE>The ancestors of my creators built it with reverence - and you should feel the same when walking those sacred halls.
