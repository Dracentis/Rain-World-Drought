Interesting.

This text is about the local aquifer. Must've been stored by Moon, since the date is...<LINE>Well, I think at that time I was still being planned, and thus didn't exist. 

Water is the most important resource for our basic function. Most of our processing is outsourced to<LINE>microbe strata which need a flow of clean water or else slag builds up, our processes seize, and<LINE>eventually we die. And come back to life. They used to say that an iterator drinks a river, but neither<LINE>of us two have seen a natural river so I suppose the analogy is lost on us, <PlayerName>!

Originally water supply was very important when placing iterators. Later there would be a great equalizer - the fact that we breathe out as much<LINE>vapor as we inhale water led to there being water available everywhere, and the latest few generations could be placed almost completely freely.

I think Moon is a little bit scared of me being built so close, but with how much water we have?<LINE>Nonsense. Not to mention I have a saline filter for the seawater.<LINE>So far, our water supply has been consistently sufficient.
