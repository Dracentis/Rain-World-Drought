// MoonReceiveSwarmer
You're reaching the end of your journey, little friend.
Thank you, for helping me.
// Pearl Intake System
It's an old pearl related to our local intake system.
Specifically, it details the designed microorganisms used in the main reservoir.
The complete report is thousands of entries long, discussing everything from the <LINE>central gravity-amplifier-style intake solution to the interactions with the developed fauna.
I'll give you the gist of it.
Back when the major cities were closer to the surface, filtered water reservoirs<LINE>were created as bioreactors to purify water and remove unwanted contaminants.
The organisms used in these tanks were not very well controlled and many different<LINE>unwanted strains of filter tissue corrupted early tanks.
Some strains were even observed blending with the natural fauna, creating extremely<LINE>resilient organisms of a very large scale.
I hope you didn’t go down there to get this, I’m not sure how the tank would react to your biology.
I suppose the mark Suns' gave you would help.
// Pearl Forest Santuary
This is...
// ...
...It has data written on it to be sure, but the format is nothing like I’ve ever seen before.
It bears some resemblance to the creature logs created by the overseers.
Most iterators simply ignore it, as it has little importance towards the Task.
I occasionally look back on those files, as it reminds me of the time back when I worked on the<LINE>tasks of an entire lively city. It was a much more complex time; I worked on everything<LINE>from coordinating farming systems to individuals’ problems or inquiries.
I do miss the days when they visited my chamber.
Anyways, back to the pearl. It appears that someone used that data format as the basis to create a<LINE>new log of individual creatures’ karmic properties and social relationships.
There is a section written in internal language as well. I can try my best to translate it.
"...organizations of the fourth axiom of karmic staging, It can be ascertained that the quintessence of<LINE>an organic body can never be entirely sequestered from the continuous flow of related<LINE>materials. I propose a contemporary project to aggregate coordinated karmic<LINE>networking" or perhaps... "encompassment of an overall site"
I am sorry little creature, are you understanding this?
I would say this is the remnants or perhaps an older log of a far-reaching project by one of the iterators in the local group.
It is hard to say which iterator, although some of the internal language suggests a slightly cynical<LINE>or humorous tone, which could narrow the possiblities.
Without knowing where it came from, I’m afraid I can’t tell you much more.
// Pearl Fragmented Exterior
Oh, wow! I didn't think I would ever see this again!
It is an old qualia that I recorded from one of the sky-sail journeys long ago.
I lost it back when one of my capacitor coils burst a few thousand cycle ago. Secondary systems and my biological<LINE>components did their best to bring it back online, but the damage shut down a few disruptors<LINE>leading to some more serious collapses.
I do not remember much of the subject, but this pearl always held an importance to me.
Thank You, <PlayerName>.

// Moon Initial Conversation
Oh...
Hello, <PlayerName>.
You must be Seven Red Suns' little messenger.
I have heard a lot about you. How is Seven Red Suns?
I am glad to see you safe and sound, it's clear that your tail is working as intended.
I have considered tinkering with creatures too. More messengers could be useful.
Communications have always been spotty, even back when our cities were still populated.
Soon enough, messengers like you might be our only way of communicating.
I... I've been holding you here for a while, little creature. I'm sorry! I'm aware that you have to go.
Thank you for visiting me! Good luck on your way to Five Pebbles!
// Moon Second+ Conversation, when she doesn't dislike you
// I wonder what it is that you want? // The following line comes after this vanilla dialogue
I have very little to give you.
// When you give Moon her own Neuron
This is one of my processing neurons, I need them for continued operation.
Please don't eat too many of these.
// Moon Conversation after MoonMark
Head west. Towards No Significant Harassment.
Deep down, there's an old subway system. And below that, an ancient temple.
Search your way deeper. The mark I gave you will let you through.
Good luck, <PlayerName>.

It's you.
How could you betray me like this!
All this work, cycles and cycles of efforts put to waste!
// ...
No, I need not be angry with you. Afterall, you couldn't have known the importance of what you were delivering.
Perhaps, Moon was right about all this. I have been a bit hasty in my recent endevors.
// Pebbles Initial Conversation (Didn't delieved CC to Moon)
Hello <PlayerName>.
Welcome back!
Do you have another message for me?
Or are you passing through here for another delivery?
Unless you have something for me, I must return to my work.
// Pebbles Second+ Conversation (Delieved CC to Moon)
You're back.
I know I shouldn't be angry with you.
I suppose, we both gained something out of this. Even, if I lost some of my efforts.
Afterall, you couldn't have known the importance of what you were delivering.

Best of luck to you, <PlayerName>.
// Pearl Intake System
This is a lengthy report on the unwanted organism strains that developed<LINE>in the old water filtration systems.
Back when cities were closer to the surface many of the cities relied on old bioreactor<LINE>reservoirs for a clean water supply.
This was early in the development of the genetic sciences, so some unwanted strains developed.
In attempts to mediate the damage, they biult a small<LINE>intelligent organic network tasked with controlling or at least mediating any organisms that developed.
It was similar in design to modern iterators. There are rumors of murmurs coming from the depths
I don’t suppose you crawled down there yourself. It would be quite dangerous.
// Pearl Forest Santuary
This one is strange; it looks to be the data from an offhand project by one of the local iterators.
It has sections referencing interactions with local fauna, and some<LINE>unconventional data tables related to the local fauna.
The section in internal language represents an interesting insight about<LINE>the embedding of karmic energy in matter and more specifically how it can affect other organizations.
I’m not sure what else to say about it. Based on the amount of data in this pearl I find it likely that the project is still ongoing.
// Pearl Fragmented Exterior
It's qualia, or a moment – this one is longer than most. Someone is dragging and tying a decorated rope from a sky-sail, while glancing towards the rest of their group.
It has decent resolution, although its emotional value seem much more significant.
The original memory was probably collected from Moon’s city.
