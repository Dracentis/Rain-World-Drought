You're terribly, terribly persistent about this pearl for some reason, <PlayerName>!<LINE>This isn't for me.

I guess I could take a look into it. It's of such a wondrous color too.<LINE>Alright, give me a moment, my little envoy, I will read it.

. . .

. . .

W-what... What is the meaning of this?! 

I AM ASKING YOU WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS!?     

. . .

No, no this cannot be... Just what...<LINE>No, I shouldn't be angry at you, you couldn't know.

You couldn't know what you're delivering to Five Pebbles.<LINE>I fear to ask what you have been delivering to him and Seven Red Suns before!<LINE>No. This must not fall into Five Pebbles' hands.

As a senior iterator it is my job to protect him and my local group.

What allowed Suns to even daresay such an option feasible?<LINE>Did he ever think about what will happen to Five Pebbles if this was attempted?<LINE>To me?

There is no proof that this will work.<LINE>There is no proof that this won't cause harm to Five Pebbles.<LINE>This should be purged.

. . .

Done. Now this won't reach Five Pebbles.

To think that something like that was being delivered for hundreds of cycles!<LINE>I'm glad I could stop Five Pebbles' destruction before it was too late.<LINE>And not without your help, of course, little creature!

Oh, don't look at me with such sad eyes.

You failed your mission, but you saved my brother. Together I'm sure we will solve The Task.<LINE>I'm sorry I displayed anger at you. You saved Five Pebbles, after all.

I understand, that we, iterators, weren't created to ascend, but this...<LINE>This is direct violation of The Task and basically suicide.<LINE>I don't need to triangulate this to know the results will cause issues.

I will be contacting Five Pebbles and Seven Red Suns.<LINE>I have a serious talk prepared for them... Those fools!<LINE>Please don't contact either of them from now on, for your own sake and mine.

Thank you for giving me this pearl, for showing me how blind I was.
