This is a lengthy report on the unwanted organism strains that developed<LINE>in the old water filtration systems.

Back when cities were closer to the surface many of the cities relied on old bioreactor<LINE>reservoirs for a clean water supply.

This was early in the development of the genetic sciences, so some unwanted strains developed.

In attempts to mediate the damage, they biult a small<LINE>intelligent organic network tasked with controlling or at least mediating any organisms that developed.

It was similar in design to modern iterators. There are rumors of murmurs coming from the depths.

I don't suppose you crawled down there yourself. It would be quite dangerous.
