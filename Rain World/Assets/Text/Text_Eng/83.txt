This pearl feels quite foul to the touch.

It is a lengthy report on struggles to combat unwanted organism strains that<LINE>developed in the older designs of water filtration systems.

Back when cities were closer to the surface many of the cities relied on now outdated bioreactor<LINE>reservoirs for a clean water supply. At least that's what Moon used to tell me.<LINE>This was early in the prime of the genetic sciences, so some the results were,<LINE>at times, dubious at best.

One of such mistakes created a strain of bacteria that rapidly consumed organic matter<LINE>and converted it into more of itself, clogging the pipes, creating filthy mold<LINE>and simply making the water dirtier.<LINE>As per the norm, there was an outrage amongst the monks.

In attempts to mediate the damage, a small intelligent organic network<LINE>tasked with controlling or at least mediating any undesirable organisms that<LINE>developed in its presence was made. Again, to significant displeasure of the monks.

However, the new design worked fantastically well. The bacteria was similar in design to modern iterators.<LINE>Well...<LINE>I suppose that is a stretch, but the limitations and task were similar, in a way.

Sliver of Straw didn't have a dedicated reservoir like mine, so she commonly<LINE>joked about murmurs coming from the depths of my intake system.<LINE>Those aren't true, of course. A bacteria would never reach the grandeur of iterators.

Now that I've finished talking about this pearl - please take it away.<LINE>I know where it's from, I don't want any of those bacteria here, and...<LINE>I don't suppose you brought it from down there yourself?

Not that I'm worried about you, but that place can be dangerous.
