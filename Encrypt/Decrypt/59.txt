It's an old text. The verses are written by none other than Twelve Plates, One Opening.<LINE>The language is very old and intricate, so let me explain the gist of the text.<LINE>It's a very old poem, these are countless and all the same, mostly.

"...for That is how We are Woven into the World, the Meanings and Points intertwined, the Bodies and Desires minced<LINE>together. No Separation, and no Escape - a dull Knife to Solve our Problems - and still - No Exit. Holding onto each<LINE>Other - but We Are Other, holding each Other. The World is Thus, and Thus are We, the We of the World"

This is the excerpt from the first verse. Basically it says, that we're knit into the world like strings<LINE> into a rug, creating a mess, and not even cutting it solves anything.<LINE>Holding onto each other, we hold each other in place, locking away our chances to escape.

Then there is this part.<LINE>"unlike Lowers and Weak, We Are allowed to be Reborn into this World - but like Lowers and Weak We Are, for That is the Truth."

Here they basically compare themselves to parasites living in furry hide of an animal - leeching off of it.<LINE>However they also later mention that they only get entangled into this 'net' even more as they allow themselves to prosper. 

...Ugh, this is a boring, and untrue. The poem I mean.<LINE>The one great thought they followed is at the very end. The monk kept it to herself until the very end<LINE>to make us read the whole thing, didn't she?

Basically, she says we shouldn't try to live, to prosper or develop. To not let the threads of life catch us,<LINE>to go with the flow.

This was an eternal dilemma to them - they were burdened by great ambition,<LINE>yet deeply convinced that striving in itself was an unforgivable vice.<LINE>They tried very hard to be effortless. Perhaps that's what we were to them,<LINE>someone to delegate that unrestrained effort to. 

Personally, I don't fancy their efforts, this Task is a nuisance to me, and I hate it with compassion.<LINE>But that feeling is what they felt for ages, and this thought is what keeps me judicious when I talk about them.
