This one is an old conversation between me and Seven Red Suns. I... won't read it to you.

For the local group - I try my best.<LINE>For them, and for myself.<LINE>That's all you have to know. Really.

I know you aren't someone to recite my problems to, but this pearl contains some... not quite pleasant<LINE>memories, that belong to me. The feelings inside still haunt me - even stronger than before.

If you took it away - I'd be thankful, little creature.
