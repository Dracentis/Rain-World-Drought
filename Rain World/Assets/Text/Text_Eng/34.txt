This is a slime mold plasmodium. Thank you, but I can't eat this.

...It looks disgusting, I'm not gonna lie to you.<LINE>If I were you - I'd throw it away immediately, <PlayerName>.

. . .

This mold grows in very damp places, I've been told. Seven Red Suns informed me before, he had to take<LINE>a look at them closer, in attempts to extract its genome and make a glowing purposed creature.<LINE>As well as a funny pet for Sliver of Straw, his friend.

But this slime mold is actually unicellular - despite its size... So extracting genome from it was a messy and difficult work.<LINE>I don't know if he succeeded. I hope he did?

The monks... Believed, that this unearthly glow, despite it being perfectly explicable due to the chemical compounds, came<LINE>from the Void Sea itself. It was a missionary to our world, growing only in those places that are dying.<LINE>Truly dying. Erased from existence, ascended - doesn't truly matter.

Of course I cannot confirm this, but I truly believe this to be true.<LINE>I don't know where you got it - but it must have been a very desecrated place.<LINE>I feel sorry for it and its inhabitants.
