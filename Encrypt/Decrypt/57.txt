It's a production record of a mask factory, its last time in service.<LINE>I doubt you have seen any bone masks. You will have to visit Chasing Winds for a chance of that - her factories<LINE>were the oldest, thus touched the least. Perhaps one or two still remain intact.

In ancient times the masks were for covering the face as a way to symbolically nullify your personality, your self.<LINE>But then, of course, our creators couldn't leave it as that - so they attached various accessories to<LINE>those masks, giving a part of their selves back. Pretty inane, I know.

Originally monks in a temple would make the masks using bone plaster, and when the production was automated it would<LINE>generally remain on the same site. So that the old stones could... radiate the material with holiness, I suppose?<LINE>I honestly never understood how it all works. Sounded and still sounds like a silly tale.

This mask is from a facility called Side House. Not too far from me. In the iterator projects many<LINE>old industrial-religious sites like this were remodeled and incorporated.
