Oh, wow! I didn't think I would ever see this again!<LINE>I had it somewhere around here many, many cycles ago, but lost it, somehow.

It is an old qualia, sent to me by an overseer a lot of cycles ago.<LINE>And I mean - a lot!

What's on it? Oh, just clouds, with the sun peeking through.<LINE>Nothing more, really! Ah...

Maybe we weren't built to experience... adoration? To like something? We have The Task to take<LINE>care of, but here I am, reminiscing of the long times ago when the skies<LINE>weren't cloudy so often. I wonder if my creators would consider me broken for that?

I must have lost this pearl back when one of my capacitor coils burst.<LINE>Secondary systems and my biological components did their best to bring it back online, but the damage<LINE>shut down a few disruptors leading to some more serious collapses.

Oh, don't worry about me! I'm doing perfectly fine without them, as you can see.<LINE>Besides, you brought me a piece of my old memories!<LINE>Thank you, <PlayerName>. This is very important to me!

...<LINE>In fact, let me just... Copy the data from it into a couple other pearls and also save a copy in my<LINE>memory frames. You know, just for safety.

There, now you can take it.<LINE>Thank you again, little creature.
