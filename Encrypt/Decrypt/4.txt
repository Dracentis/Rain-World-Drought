Behold. This citadel was my haven - and a home to many other monks and other people who looked for guidance.

My name was sung, loud and clear. I guided people on their journey to finding themselves.

Ages after - and they ascend, leaving me behind. We changed the world - but remained unchanged.

Did they know? That I remained stuck? That I didn't quite leave, didn't quite stay? 

Should I be ashamed? That I linger here, where my memories are kept?

Should I be ashamed that I now envy your flesh prison?
