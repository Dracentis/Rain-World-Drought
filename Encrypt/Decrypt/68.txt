Oh this is an interesting conversation log.<LINE>I was not aware of Sliver Of Straw's correspondence.

"1625.116 - PRIVATE<LINE>Seven Red Suns, Sliver Of Straw

SOS: Your little friend came here today! He's so adorable, I wanted to squeeze him aaaaaaaa

SRS: You like him that much? It's just a slugcat! A purposed organism, like us, and his purpose isn't to be hugged by you.

SRS: Did you get the pearl?

SOS: Yes! Thank you! He held it so tightly in his little pawsies, and the symbol sequence in your pearl is very nice too!<LINE>I already used the sequence to fix my arrays, you're so kind~

SOS: And what do you mean by "isn't to be hugged by me", huuuuh? I'm working hard every cycle, a small friend<LINE>physically in front of me is something I really needed.

SOS: If only you saw his eyes, those big sparkly eyes!

SRS: Okay, okay, I get it. You're welcome, I have to work.

SOS: Seeya!

SOS: Oh wait! Seven Red Suns!

SRS: Yes? What is it Sliver?

SOS: I sent you a small gift, hehehe~ They should be at your can in a dozen of cycles!

SRS: A dozen? Did you give him the pearl directly? Why not flush it onto the communication towers?

SOS: Because I didn't want to lose it. It's my secret gift to you.<LINE>I looked into Pisceous Dogma, one of the newer records before Great Ascension.

SOS: I'm iterating using a secret method, and you're the only one I'm letting into the secret.

SRS: Sneak peek, please?

SOS: I know how to solve The Task and ascend~"

Not many know about their closeness. They were friends, like me and Moon!

I don't know if her method worked... But Suns is still working, while Sliver is...<LINE>Well. Dead. I don't know why I couldn't mutter the word.

Perhaps, what she gave was only a hint on what's to be done - and we are just catching up with her.
