It's an old pearl related to our local intake system.

Specifically, it details the designed microorganisms used in the main reservoir.

The complete report is thousands of entries long, discussing everything from the <LINE>central gravity-amplifier-style intake solution to the interactions with the developed fauna.

I'll give you the gist of it.

Back when the major cities were closer to the surface, filtered water reservoirs<LINE>were created as bioreactors to purify water and remove unwanted contaminants.

The organisms used in these tanks were not very well controlled and many different<LINE>unwanted strains of filter tissue corrupted early tanks.

Some strains were even observed blending with the natural fauna, creating extremely<LINE>resilient organisms of a very large scale.

I hope you didn't go down there to get this, I'm not sure how the tank would react to your biology.

I suppose the mark Suns' gave you would help.
