It's a production record of a mask factory, for what seems to be its last time in service.<LINE>Have you seen a bone mask? Likely not, they are all gone with their owners.

In ancient times the masks were actually about showing spiritual persuasion - covering the<LINE>face as a way to symbolically abate the self. Then of course, that was quite subverted as<LINE>excessively ornate and lavish masks became an expression of identity. Some public persons<LINE>did have problems with narrow doorways.

Originally monks in a temple would make the masks using bone plaster, and when the production was automated it would<LINE>generally remain on the same site. So that the old stones could... radiate the material with holiness, I suppose.

This is from one such facility called Side House, which was here on Pebble's grounds. In the iterator projects many<LINE>old industrial-religious sites like this were remodeled and incorporated. I think this one was made to provide pellets<LINE>of holy ash to Pebbles, but knowing him he probably hasn't used much of it!

Even with the passing of our creators, the world still lives on. We are their<LINE>legacy. And even countless cycles after the departure of the last Parent<LINE>on Northern Grand Ivory's can - the life below continues.

Ages, eons will pass - but our creators' legacy will live on.<LINE>If not in us - then at least in there other creations.
