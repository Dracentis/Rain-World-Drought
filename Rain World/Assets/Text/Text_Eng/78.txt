Oh, wow! I didn't think I would ever see this again!

It is an old qualia that I recorded from one of the sky-sail journeys long ago.

I lost it back when one of my capacitor coils burst a few thousand cycle ago. Secondary systems and my biological<LINE>components did their best to bring it back online, but the damage shut down a few disruptors<LINE>leading to some more serious collapses.

I do not remember much of the subject, but this pearl always held an importance to me.

Thank You, <PlayerName>.
