The development of purposed organisms was a major accomplishment that allowed for our creation.

We were designed with many smaller organic parts to handle<LINE>processes and adapt to different situations.

Our creators didn't want us to manipulate our organic components, since <LINE> this could pose serious danger to the entire city and the iterator involved.<LINE>They created certain taboos hard coded into our genome. One of which prevented the manipulation of our genome.

For this reason, it is very difficult for iterators to experiment with purposed organisms.

Some iterators took on case studies on the local fauna, acquiring outside organic matter<LINE>for limited experiments. I was the first to break the taboo and create some organisms of my own.
