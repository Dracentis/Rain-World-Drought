It's the blueprint for a Void Fluid filtration system.<LINE>I think you might remember what Void Fluid is.

I'm afraid I don't have the bath for you. If anything - I shouldn't even bring that topic up.<LINE>But you've been working hard, so let's talk about it, since your salvation is near.

Hmmm, how do I explain it to you...<LINE>Perhaps, one of Moon's descriptions would work. I don't remember it perfectly, but it went like this.

If you leave a stone on the ground, it will be covered in dust later. This happens<LINE>everywhere and to everything, and over several lifetimes of creatures such as you,<LINE>the ground slowly builds upwards. 

So why doesn't the ground collide with the sky? Because far down, under the very, very old layers of the earth,<LINE>the rock and everything else is being dissolved or removed.<LINE>The entity which does this is known as the Void Sea.

If you drill far enough into the earth you begin encountering a substance called Void Fluid.<LINE>The deeper you go, the less rock and more Void Fluid. It's believed that there is a point<LINE>where the rock completely gives way - below that would be the Void Sea.

When that stone you placed on the ground has finally done its time in the sediments,<LINE>it meets the Void Fluid and is dissolved, leaving the physical world.

The ancients figured out a way to use Void Fluid. Not only to ascend, but also as an energy source.<LINE>This brought a revolution to their then rudimentary society. Even I didn't exist back then.<LINE>The Void Fluid drills were what started the big technological leap, but this is very<LINE>long before I entered this world. 

A Void Fluid filtration system is used because if you take Void Fluid from close to the bedrock horizon,<LINE>it will contain traces of rock and dirt. They bring in dirty fluid and then filter it to increase its purity.<LINE>The other way is to put a pipe deeper, which works well for some time, but the pipe dissolves.<LINE>Or is broken by some... force - no one really knows, you don't go down there and come back up.

Ironically, only after our creators were finally gone, I started to question myself something.

Where does the dust come from? Water that I evaporate from the ground comes back rushing down onto it with rain.<LINE>So what is this dust? Where does it come from? Chemical analyses won't tell you the origin.

Perhaps, the ancients' bodies turned into that dust. Like everything else in the void sea.<LINE>And if not - will the sea below keep rising over the eons? Will it one day consume us?

My thought processes are slagged sometimes. I apologize.<LINE>But still... It doesn't let me rest that easily.

The most obvious explanation would be that monks saw the world differently from how it actually is.<LINE>Which means my knowledge is built on lies.
