It's a confirmation to an automated farming plot that a shipment of beverages has arrived.<LINE>Happened thousands of cycles ago, the scans of the confirmation are still in my memory.

Would you like me to read it out loud to you? Not that you'd bother reading into the nuances<LINE>of the phraseology, but my time with you is a nice outlet for my languor.

"On regards of the (by spiritual splendor eternally graced) people of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness,<LINE>we Wish to congratulate (o so thankfully) this Facility on its Loyal and Relished services, and to Offer our Hopes and<LINE>Aspirations that the Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation may continue, for as long as the Stars stay fixed on their<LINE>Celestial Spheres and/or the Cooperation continues to be Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory."

"It is with Honor I, Eight Suns-Countless Leaves, of the House of Six Wagons, Count of no living blocks, Counselor of 2, Duke of 1,<LINE>Humble Secretary of the Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness, write this to You."

"We hope that the Crops are healthy, and..."

Are you even listening, <PlayerName>?<LINE>Your small brain cannot process that much information, so perhaps this all sounds boring to you.

"Leaning on the Solid Foundation of our Long Running Fruitful and Mutually Satisfactory Cooperation, we will take the liberty of stating<LINE>The Reason for this Message ~ we write to Warmly thank You for yet Another Timely and Appreciated delivery of your Product (Nectar) to our<LINE>Community (Congregation of Never Dwindling Righteousness). Our humble Words can never Aspire to Describe our gratitude."

"Sincerely, your Appreciative and Satisfied Acquirers: Nine Snails Unhurried Turtle; Zero Flaws Many Concerns;<LINE>Four Safes Eleven Fliers; Round Apple Abreast Bread;..."  The titles are many.

I never understood the reasoning behind such correctness. Little ants worried about their little things.<LINE>Only slowing themselves down by talking, writing nonsense all day long.
