It's a Small Plate, a little text of spiritual guidance.<LINE>It's written by a monk called Four Cabinets, Eleven Hatchets.<LINE>It's old, several ages before the Void Fluid revolution. 

The text is, of course, quite vague and ambiguous. I would read you to it, but I'm afraid you<LINE>will follow them, I wouldn't want you starved! Hahaha.

Allow me to explain, my little envoy.

Like most writing from this time it's quite shrouded in analogies, but the subject is how to shed<LINE>one of the five natural urges which tie a creature to life. Namely number four, gluttony.

It is basically an instruction on how to starve yourself<LINE>on herbal tea and gravel, but disguised as a poem.

See, why I wouldn't want you to follow them? You're quite fragile, little creature!<LINE>And you need to eat well. You might be not quite... in-kind, but<LINE>nurture is vital even to you.

Now, of course when Void Fluid was discovered these methods proved obsolete, as it was<LINE>more easy just jumping in a vat of it to effortlessly leave this world behind. 

There were some horror stories though... That if your ego was big enough, not even the Void Fluid could<LINE>entirely cross you out, and a faint echo of your pompousness would grandiosely haunt the premises forever.<LINE>Hopefully, smaller creatures are safe from this. Hopefully...

In the end? Even when the Void Fluid baths became cheaper,<LINE>some would still starve and drink the bitter tea.

I truly wish I could try it, the tea. But oh, I am so busy all the time! Not a minute of rest.<LINE>Even as we speak now - my processes are working full-time.

Though you know it, of course. How silly of me, repeating what I told you before.
