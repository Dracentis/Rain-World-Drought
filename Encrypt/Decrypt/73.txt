It's an active working memory - raw data has been dropped here in order to later be<LINE>pasted to a currently occupied memory conflux. Without context it's just a jumble. 
It is the impression of being a small creature, like a wall climbing lizard, looking <LINE>up into the branches of a big tree. The last third is partly overwritten with a number <LINE>series I vaguely recognize, I think Moon sent it to me at some point.
Seven... intertwined number series? I don't quite understand the utility of this. <LINE>Might a key for a cipher processor, customized for some other data which is impossible to infer from this.
An active working memory. Without knowing where this was cut from or where it's to be pasted to, <LINE>it is not really possible to decipher it. If I had to guess, I would say it has something to <LINE>do with trance inducing number series. 
It's just an active working memory, I can't really tell you anything without the context.
Without the process surrounding this data there isn't much I can tell you.
This one is filled with short excerpts from Moon's researches.<LINE>Very old stuff, but I assume she's still writing them down. 
Hey, I recognize this data! Moon sent it to me a few thousand cycles ago.<LINE>Did you take this from Moon?
Did you take this from Looks to the Moon?<LINE>This one is filled with her short essays on grandeur of our ancestors.<LINE>Laughable, I know, but they were her life.
You really shouldn't take these pearls from Looks to the Moon.<LINE>She needs them for her work. This one is her active working memory.
This one has 885 various synonyms to the word "cycle". All of them are qualia, not words.
This is some sort of a very long cipher. Four sets of numbers, intertwined together and passing through<LINE>medium-resolution qualiae, adjusting the sequence in the process to fit specific needs of the iterator.<LINE>Think of it as a key to the drawer with your recent notes. Though, I'm not sure you know what a drawer is...
How peculiar. This is a high resolution image of you, <PlayerName>! This must be one of many very early concepts<LINE>of a purposed creature for deliveries. Not everything can be sent over text, you know.
This is a saved state of an unfinished process. This version dates back 2 days, so Moon<LINE>probably won't be looking for something so old anymore.
It's a high resolution picture of some sort of mold growing on a corpse of a lizard.<LINE>I don't know if it's a new type of flora - ask Suns later. I wonder why Moon has it...
This pearl is filled to the brim with jumbled mess. I could try to run some analyses on it, but I'm sure<LINE>without the process itself around it - I won't be able to make out anything sensible.
A recent scan of a memory conflux. Seems a bit rundown, but far from a critical state.
Moon's collection of mantras. This one seems to be a bit old - not that there are new ones appearing, but<LINE>I just know she keeps making copies in case she loses some.
This is a working memory, an active one of course. Without the context - I can't say anything about what<LINE>it actually is. Though, the data seems to be divided into two parts - and the second part is<LINE>some kind of sound? It's a rhythmic buzzing of bugs, mixed with clanking metal.
