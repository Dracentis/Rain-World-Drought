Is this for me? Must be what Seven Red Suns wanted to deliver.<LINE>I have been awaiting this message.

...Oh, instructions! Finally, some sapid information on how to circumvent the taboo.

You know, <PlayerName>, the problem with breaking taboos is that the barriers are encoded<LINE>into every cell of our organic parts. And we can't rewrite it...

Not yet, at least.

Hmmm... Interesting... A small sample of living organic matter...<LINE>Re-write genome and... Oh, rewrite it this way, hm.<LINE>Specific taboo, nothing more... 

...This will be very difficult, but I think I can give it a shot.<LINE>If Suns' simulations brought fruitful results - then my tests...

...

Little purposed organism, I forgot you were standing here. I got<LINE> so enthralled... I apologize.

Your purpose ends here, <PlayerName>. You have worked very hard, and I think you<LINE> deserve some rest, at last. The pearl will remain here, with me.

From your memories you might unearth that one time I mentioned<LINE> Void Sea to you. This is your salvation.

From now on your job as an envoy is over. Seven Red Suns has already<LINE>been informed that you succeeded. I'll be very busy, so don't come back.

If you want - say hello to Moon for me.<LINE>And then - onward to your escape.
