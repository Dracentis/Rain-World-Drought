This one is an old conversation between Five Pebbles and a friend of his. I'll read it to you.

"1591.290 - PRIVATE<LINE>Five Pebbles, Seven Red Suns

FP: Can I tell you something? Lately...

FP: I'm tired of trying and trying. And angry that they left us here.<LINE>The anger makes me even less inclined to solve their puzzle for them. Why do we do this?

SRS: Yes, I'll spell this out - not because you're stupid or naive... <LINE>Also, not saying that you're not ~

FP: Please, I'm coming to you for guidance. 

SRS: Sorry, very sorry. I kid. Fact is, of course we are all aware of the evident <LINE>futility of this Big Task. It's not said out loud but if you were better at reading <LINE>between the lines there's nowhere you wouldn't see it. We're all frustrated.

FP: So why do we continue? We assemble work groups, we ponder, <LINE>we iterate and try. Some of us die. It's not fair.

SRS: Because there's not any options. What else CAN we do? You're stuck in your can, and at any <LINE>moment you have no more than two alternatives: Do nothing, or work like you're supposed to.

SRS: An analogy. You have a maze, and you have a handful of bugs. You put the bugs in the maze, and you leave. <LINE>Given infinite time, one of the bugs WILL find a way out, if they just erratically try and try. <LINE>This is why they called us Iterators. 

FP: But we do die of old age.

SRS: Even more incentive! You know that nothing ever truly dies though, around and around it goes. <LINE>Granted, our tools and resources get worse over time - but that is theoretically unproblematic, <LINE>because in time even a miniscule chance will strike a positive. <LINE>All the same to them, they're not around anymore!

FP: I struggle to accept being a bug."

You know, <PlayerName>, iterators aren't meant to ascend. We all, to an extent, feel what Five Pebbles said here.

Still, I must keep a close eye on him.
