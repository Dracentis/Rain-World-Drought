How bright and beautiful!

This is pupa shell, smeared on the inside with a glowing substance made from, as my analyses say,<LINE>lantern mice's blood, which is where the chemiluminescent bacteria<LINElive. What a curious symbiosis.

Have you been to the citadel we are standing above? This shell will prove useful there!<LINE>Ever since the fall of Ancients, it's been in a disarray. The numerous candles that<LINE>adorned the halls are long gone, who knows what lives there now.

The wondrous architecture of the times - it must be still intact!<LINE>You will see so many things - the ritual hall, the cabinet wyrms, the ornaments on the windows!<LINE>My ancestors built it with reverence - and you should feel the same when walking those sacred halls.
