This is a flowering body of some fungus. It has high pressure built up inside - when it<LINE>explodes the spores will spread everywhere.

There are no calories in this - not like it matters to you, <PlayerName>. You can't digest this anyway.<LINE>But this fungus is a very, very powerful insecticide.
