It's an old text. The verses are written by a monk called Seventeen Knots, Two Blades.<LINE>The language is very old and intricate.

The text itself is actually a poem... Well, like many others of this time.<LINE>You don't seem surprised. Of course.

The first verse starts by drawing a comparison between the world and a tangled rug.<LINE>It says that the world is an unfortunate mess. Like a knot, the nature of its existence<LINE>is the fact that the parts are locking each other, none able to spring free.

Then as it goes on the world becomes a furry animal hide, I suppose... because now us living<LINE>beings are like insects crawling in the fur. And then it's a fishing net, because the more we<LINE>struggle and squirm, the more entangled we become. 

It says that only the limp body of the jellyfish cannot be captured in the net.<LINE>So we should try to be like the jellyfish, because the jellyfish doesn't try.

This was an eternal dilemma to them - they were burdened by great ambition,<LINE>yet deeply convinced that striving in itself was an unforgivable vice.<LINE>They tried very hard to be effortless. Perhaps that's what we were to them,<LINE>someone to delegate that unrestrained effort to. 

I am, of course, blessed with carrying out their Task. I cannot be effortless, this is not what I was created for.<LINE>But I am working very hard to find the solution.

At times I feel like it's almost around the corner, but it always ends up<LINE>futile. Over ages we made little progress - but it exists!

We are trying very hard. If we can't make out creators proud, since they left us...<LINE>I at least hope we make you proud, little wanderer.
