Oh, it's a pearl! And of such a wondrous color too! Thank you, my little envoy, I will read it.

...

This is a message for Five Pebbles! Why give it to me? And it's not even encrypted.

...

...

W-what... What is the meaning of this?! 

I AM ASKING YOU WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS!?     

...

No, no this cannot be... Just what...<LINE>No, I shouldn't be angry at you, you couldn't know...

You couldn't know what you're delivering to Five Pebbles.<LINE>And what you have been delivering to him and Seven Red Suns before...

This must not fall into Five Pebbles' hands.<LINE>As a senior iterator it is my job to protect him, to protect my local group.

What allowed Seven Red Suns to even consider such an option?<LINE>Did he ever think about what will happen to Five Pebbles?

There is no proof that this will work.<LINE>There is no proof that this won't cause harm to Five Pebbles.<LINE>This should be purged.

...

...Done. Now this won't reach Five Pebbles.

To think that something like that was being delivered for hundreds of cycles...<LINE>I'm glad I could stop Five Pebbles' destruction before it was too late.

And not without your help, of course, little creature!<LINE>Oh, don't look at me with such sad eyes.

You failed your mission, but you saved my brother. Together I'm sure we will solve The Task.<LINE>I'm sorry I displayed anger at you. You saved Five Pebbles, after all.

I understand, that we, iterators, weren't created to ascend, but this...<LINE>This is direct violation of The Task and basically suicide.

I will be contacting Five Pebbles and Seven Red Suns. I have a serious talk prepared for them...<LINE>Please don't contact either of them, for your own sake and mine.

Thank you for giving me this pearl, for telling me how blind I was.
