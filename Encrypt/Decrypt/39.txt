Interesting. This mask is from a vulture.<LINE>Suns did a wonderful job creating you if you managed to steal the mask.

Didn't you turn two thousands cycles recently?

Anyway... As for the mask - it's a wonderful gift, but I am no fancier of decor. Keep it to yourself.<LINE>With that, many enemies will be scared of you. Unlike the vulture you stole it from.<LINE>Do you know that without its mask it's now being bullied by its kin? Ironic, I think.

They are descendants of purposed organisms from ages before, when their ancestors had a job to do.<LINE>I can't tell you what they were created for back then - maybe to cleanse the lands of rodents like you?

Ha-ha. I am merely kidding.<LINE>But it's a fact, that they were created for hunting something, and their "children" followed suit.

This mask is a sign for other vultures that they are of the same kind. It's what their ancestors wore.<LINE>Brainless creatures, they aren't capable of actually realizing they're attacking their<LINE>own kin if it has no mask...

In a way - this is how their numbers are controlled. They are hard to kill, and they are many, but<LINE>their total number will never go above the number of these masks in the world.
