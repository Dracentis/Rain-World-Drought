"1472.122 - PRIVATE<LINE>Northern Grand Ivory, Five Pebbles

FP: What do you want?

NGI: Nothing, I'm worried about you.

FP: Me? Why? You don't even talk in Local Group chats anyway most of the time, why the sudden worry?<LINE>And specifically about me.

NGI: You are the newest in the Local Group. Moon might think you're doing fine, but I know you aren't.

FP: If "newest" means built last, then I guess so. But differences in our construction times are minuscule in light of our total time in operation.

NGI: Listen. It's about Sliver Of Straw. I just want you to know, that you shouldn't be blaming yourself.

FP: What? You're saying that as if I killed her and now I feel guilt over it. You're an idiot for thinking that.

NGI: NO! No. That's not what I mean. I know that you think you are a failure.<LINE>I know you are growing tired of useless failed iterations piling up in your garbage base every cycle.

NGI: Sliver Of Straw did her best, and even though everything she worked on is gone - there must be traces of her work left.

NGI: Cheer up. You are doing great. We all care about you.

FP: ...I don't need this mawkish compassion. Go back to the hole you crawled out of."

I still regret my harsh reactions. I wish I could just apologize.<LINE>NGI is ignoring me, though. Or, maybe he's dead too...
