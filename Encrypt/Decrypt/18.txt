Interesting... This one is written by me. It's an essay on a very... influential event, solemn through and through.

It's about an iterator called Sliver of Straw. I wrote it many cycles ago...<LINE>Do you know Sliver of Straw? She's quite legendary among us.

Would you like to hear about her?

Of course you would. Who else would tell you about events of the past, so deeply ingrained into the menology of<LINE>our world.	Settle down, <PlayerName>.

The iterator herself, Sliver of Straw, was a very good friend of many other iterators in the local group. She was<LINE>industrious, as well as somewhat goofy - a unique trait that helped her pal up with almost everyone who wasn't<LINE>neck deep in processes. Five Pebbles absolutely adored her, you know? He wouldn't spend even 17 cycles without mentioning her.

Our local group... Well. All local groups are quite small, at best 56.3 gongs betwixt farthest points.<LINE>Sliver was the farthest from us, so the connection with her wasn't the best - yet she always reached out for us, sharing<LINE>all sorts of crazy ideas on how to solve The Task!<LINE>And she absolutely loved watching flora and fauna develop around her and around the world - this is why she talked a lot to NSH.

But, of course, with her attitude and approaches to finding the solution - she was bound to find it sooner or later.<LINE>...Sorry for the long winded talk. So, why is she so legendary?

Sliver of Straw was... and is the only one to ever broadcast a specific signal: the Big Problem we're all working on has been solved.<LINE>The triple affirmative - affirmative that a solution has been found, affirmative that the solution is portable, and affirmative<LINE>that a technical implementation is possible and generally applicable. She's also one of few that has ever been confirmed as<LINE>exhaustively incapacitated, or dead. We do not die easily.

Sliver of Straw sent this and the ensuing commotion was historically unparalleled, before or after.<LINE>I still remember it. But... nothing happened - except that Sliver of Straw was apparently dead.<LINE>When the dust settled we were all still there blinking at each other.

Everyone had a theory. Some said that she did have a solution, but that the solution itself<LINE>was somehow dangerous. These later became known as the Triangulators, who think that a solution<LINE>should be inferred without being directly discovered. 

Some said she never had a solution, she just died.<LINE>And when the systems broke down an erroneous signal was sent.

One camp claimed that dying *was* the solution. 

Either way, after that these different factions developed, as well as a huge forensic effort<LINE>to recreate and simulate Sliver of Straw's last moments. Some of the simulations were wrapped<LINE>in a simulation wrapped in a simulation, in case something dangerous might happen.<LINE>Nothing much has come from it.

After all this time, I can only hope someone has the information on her methods. With every dead<LINE>iterator - I feel like we're getting closer to the solution.<LINE>We do not die easily - so some of them came dangerously close to solving The Task...

In my essay I make the case that maybe she should be allowed to rest in peace now.
