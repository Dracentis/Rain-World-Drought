It's a plant that keeps pressurised air in these globules. I'm not very familiar with contemporary flora,<LINE>so I can't tell you much more.

It looks really nice though! I could've, maybe, decorated this room with these plants. But they<LINE>need a very damp environment to grow...

Well, as you know - I can't allow myself to get all wet.

Anyway, if you ever visit Seven Red Suns again - ask him about the plant. He'll tell you everything he knows.
