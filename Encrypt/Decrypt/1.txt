I've seen you walk these lands so many times... 

What do you feel, creature? Watching the ruinous abomination that is this place. 

No matter the deference, what kept I in my hands - was not enough to save it. 

The time... It treads carefully, but inevitably. My lands are no longer what they were. 

It doesn't matter now. Not to others. But I remain - watching the sun rise and enliven this collapsed beauty.

As long as my memory holds the remembrance of this glory - I cannot go. And thus - I reminisce.
