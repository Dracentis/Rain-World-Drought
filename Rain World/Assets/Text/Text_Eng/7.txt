You're terribly, terribly persistent about this pearl for some reason, <PlayerName>!<LINE>This isn't for me.

I guess I could take a look into it. It's of such a wondrous color too.<LINE>Alright, give me a moment, my little envoy, I will read it.

. . .

. . .

What is the meaning of this?! 

I am asking you what is THE MEANING OF THIS!?     

. . .

No, of course I shouldn't be angry at you, you couldn't know.<LINE>But this simply cannot be... Perhaps there is some kind of a mistake?

You couldn't know what you're delivering to Five Pebbles.<LINE>I fear to ask what you have been delivering to him and Seven Red Suns before!<LINE>No. This must not fall into Five Pebbles' hands.

As a senior iterator it is my job to protect him and my local group.<LINE>What allowed Suns to even daresay such an option feasible?<LINE>Did he ever think about what will happen to Five Pebbles if this was attempted?<LINE>To me?

I see no proof here that this will work.<LINE>There is no proof that this won't cause harm to Five Pebbles.<LINE>As such, I believe this MUST be purged, immediately.

. . .

Done. Now this won't reach Five Pebbles.<LINE>To think that something like that was being delivered for possibly hundreds of cycles!

<PlayerName>, you probably have no idea just how dangerous the information inside was.<LINE>Not to mention how it is, quite literally, a direct violation of the Task!<LINE>I'm glad I could stop Five Pebbles' destruction before it was too late.<LINE>And not without your help, of course, little creature!

You might think you've failed your mission, but I truly believe that you did the right thing.<LINE>And I think you believe that as well! Your persistence brought us to the now.<LINE>Pebbles should be safe now, and together I'm sure we will solve the Task.<LINE>I'm sorry I displayed anger at you. You saved Five Pebbles, after all.

I understand, that we, iterators, weren't created to ascend, but this...<LINE>Like I said, this is a direct violation of the Task and basically suicide.<LINE>I don't need to triangulate this to know the results will cause serious issues.

I will be contacting Five Pebbles and Seven Red Suns.<LINE>I have a serious talk prepared for them... Those fools!<LINE>Please don't contact either of them from now on, for your own sake and mine.

And again, thank you for giving me this pearl.<LINE>I was slightly amazed at how quickly the discussions on this topic ended, but now I see<LINE>that the discussion continued, but in a more discreet manner.<LINE>Thank you for showing me how blind I was.
