Hello, <PlayerName>.<LINE>Did you bring me something?

I haven't seen you in a long time! How is Seven Red Suns?<LINE>I am glad to see you safe and sound, it's clear that your tail is working as intended.

I have considered tinkering with creatures too. More messengers could be useful.<LINE>Communications have always been spotty, even back when our cities were still populated.

Soon enough, messengers like you might be our only way of communicating.<LINE>Though perhaps I am being too pessimistic?

I guess you don't have anything for me yet. That means you're visiting Pebbles?<LINE>I've been holding you here for a while, little creature. I'm sorry, I'm aware that you have to go!

Thank you for visiting me! Good luck on your way to Five Pebbles!
