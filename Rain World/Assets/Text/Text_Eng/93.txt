Silver Of Straw's fate was a mystery for a very long time.

Many iterators tried to simulate her demise with the data collected from overseers and her last transmissions.

Considering my location relatively close to her, I play a large part in these efforts.

It wasn't until we were all but disconnected that I found a way to probe deeper into the complex.

I lost a few of my creations in there, <PlayerName>.
