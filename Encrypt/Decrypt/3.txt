The fields, unchanging...

I do not need eyes to see the swaying grasses in the winds of change.

I do not need ears to hear the critters, the life flourishing in these broken spaces.

I feel everything around me, enjoying it, taking it all in...

But bound to a place - I find myself talking to a dimwitted creature.
